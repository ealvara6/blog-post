# Postifly
### A modern tech stack forum app built with authentication, likes system, and theming

Postfily is a full-stack blog application I built as a personal learning project to practice and showcase modern web development. It features user authentication, post creation and editing, comments, likes, profile pictures, and a dark/light theme toggle. The project gave me hands-on experience with React + Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma, while also teaching me about RESTful API design, database relationships, and deployment workflows with Vercel and Railway.
